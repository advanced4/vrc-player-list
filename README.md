If you're willing to run a random exe file, you can download a pre-compiled version here: https://github.com/advanced4/vrc-player-list/releases/tag/v1release
otherwise you can build it yourself with the instructions below

## Instructions to build yourself
First, using pip3 or your python IDE install the dependencies: pytz, tzlocal, and prettytable.

Then I just used https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/ to convert the python file to an exe.
Set "Onefile" to "One File" and also set "Console Window" to "Window Based", set the input script
and output directory accordingly, and generate the exe
